# pyCancerSig
# A python package for deciphering cancer signatures.

Comprehensive cancer signatures with a main workflow in nextflow, and reusable modules written in python.
Integrate SNV, SV and MSI profiles in signatures decomposed using non-negative matrix factorisation, and produce production ready pdf reports. 

## Installation

Dependencies - Currently, feature extraction of structural variants was based on data generated by FindSV and feature extraction of microsatellite instability was based on data generated by MSIsensor
- [FindSV](https://github.com/J35P312/FindSV)
- [MSIsensor](https://github.com/ding-lab/msisensor)
- [samtools](https://samtools.github.io) - used by `cancersig profie snv`
- [ANNOVAR](http://annovar.openbioinformatics.org) - used by `cancersig profile snv`
- [vt](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Vt) - used by `cancersig profile snv`

Install the dependencies, then download and install pyCancerSig

```
git clone https://github.com/jessada/pyCancerSig.git
cd pyCancerSig
python setup.py install
echo -e "# set pyCancerSig environment variable\nexport PYCANCERSIG=`pwd`\n" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc      # or logout and re-login
```



## Workflow steps

The workflow consists of 4 steps

1. Data preprocessing - The purpose of this step is to generate list of variants and/or information related. This step has to be performed by third party software.
    - Single nucleotide variant (SNV) - recommending MuTect2, otherwise Muse, VarScan2, or SomaticSniper.
    - Structural variant (SV) - dependency on FindSV
    - Microsatellite instability (MSI) - dependency on MSIsensor
2. Profiling (Feature extraction) - `cancersig profile` - The purpose of this step is to turn information genereated in the first step into matrix features usable by the model in the next step. The output of this stage has similar format as https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/assets/signatures_probabilities.txt, which consists of at least 3 columns.
    1. Column 1, Variant type (Substitution Type in COSMIC)
    2. Column 2, Variant subgroup (Trinucleotide in COSMIC)
    3. Column 3, Feature ID (Somatic Mutation Type in COSMIC)
    4. From column 4 onward, each column represent one sample

    There are subcommand to be used for each type of genetic variation
    - `cancersig feature snv` is for extraction single nucletide variant feature
    - `cancersig feature sv` is for extraction structural variant feature
    - `cancersig feature msi` is for extraction microsatellite instability feature
    - `cancersig feature merge` is for merging all feature profiles into one single profile ready to be used by the next step
3. Deciphering mutational signatures - `cancersig signature` - The purpose of this step is to use unsupervised learning model to find mutational signature components in the tumors.
4. Visualizing profiles `cancersig visualize` - The purpose of this step is to visualize mutational signature component for each tumor.

## Examples and details - Step 1 Data preprocessing

As this part is performed by third-party software, please check the original website for the documentation
- [Single nucleotide variant (SNV)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/3.8-0/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_cancer_m2_MuTect2.php)
- [Structural variant (SV)](https://github.com/J35P312/FindSV)
- [Microsatellite instability (MSI)](https://github.com/ding-lab/msisensor)

## Examples and details - Step 2 Profiling (Feature extraction)

###### 2.1 SNV profiling

`cancersig profile snv` will
- scan the VCF file in the genotype field (default="GTR") for SNV changes on both strands
- then, use the genomic coordinates to look up the 5\' and 3\' base in the reference fasta (using samtools)
- then, perform SNV profiling of the sample by counting number of SNVs in each category and divide it by total number of variants in the sample.

The sample id in the output feature file will be the same as sample id in the input VCF file.

Example run:
```
cancersig profile snv -i input.vcf -r /path/to/reference.fa -o snv_feature.txt
```

[Example SNV feature output](./example/output_snv_feature.txt)

###### 2.2 SV profiling

`cancersig profile sv` will
- check INFO field "SVTYPE" to determine type of structural variation
- check INFO field "SVLEN" for length of the event
- then, perform SV profiling of the sample by counting number of SVs in each category and divide it by total number of variants in the sample.

The sample id in the output feature file will be the same as sample id in the input VCF file (column 10).

Example run:
```
cancersig profile sv -i input.vcf -o sv_feature.txt
```

[Example SV feature output](./example/output_sv_feature.txt)

###### 2.3 MSI profiling

`cancersig profile msi` will
- scan for all possible repeat patterns of repeat unit with size between 1-3
- for size between 4-5, just count with no sub-categories
- then, perform MSI profiling of the sample by counting number of repeats in each category and divide it by total number of repeats.

The sample id in the output feature file has to be supplied as an input argument (--sample_id).

Example run:
```
cancersig profile msi --raw_msisensor_report msisensor_out --raw_msisensor_somatic msisensor_out_somatic --sample_id example_sample -o msi_feature.txt
```

[Example MSI feature output](./example/output_msi_feature.txt)

###### 2.4 Merge profile

`cancersig profile merge` will
- scan for \*feature.txt or \*profile.txt files in the input folder(s)
- if a sample has all feature of all mutation types (SNV, SV, MSI), it will be merged into one profile. The percentage weight of SNV, SV and MSI are 70%, 30% and 10% respectively.

Example run:
```
cancersig profile merge -i /path/to/first/dir,/path/to/second/dir -o merged_feature.txt
```
Example run for mergeing certain profile types (SV and SNV in this case:
```
cancersig profile merge -i /path/to/first/dir,/path/to/second/dir -o merged_feature.txt --profile_types SNV,SV
```

[Example merged feature file](./example/output_merged_feature.txt)

## Examples and details - Step 3 Deciphering mutational sigantures

`cancersig signature` will
- load mutational matrix profile
- identify underlying mutational signatures following EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3588146/pdf/main.pdf

Example run:
```
cancersig signature --mutation_profile merged_mutational_profile.txt --out_prefix output_deciphered
```

Example output:
- [Example of signature probabilities (4 signatures)](./example/output_deciphered_4_signatures.txt)
- [Example of deciphered signatures (4 signatures)](./example/output_deciphered_4_signatures.pdf)

## Example and details - Step 4 Visualizing profile

`cancersig visualize` will
- display mutational signature composition of the sample
- display the original mutaitonal profile
- display the reconstruction mutational profile (based on the recomposition)
- display the reconstruction error
